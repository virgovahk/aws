# AWS learning journey

This repository documents my personal journey learning AWS.

My goals are:

- Build a solid understanding of the core AWS services
- Get familiar with cloud terminology and best practices
- Complete hands-on projects to reinforce learning
- Get the *AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner* certificate.

Each folder in this repo is an AWS project with its own README.

Every project README includes:

- Project overview
- Steps taken to build it
- AWS services used
- Learning outcomes
- Screenshots
